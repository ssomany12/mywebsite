# The Bechdel Test

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/

The [Bechdel test](https://bechdeltest.com) is a way to assess how women are depicted in Hollywood movies.  In order for a movie to pass the test:

1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

There is a nice article and analysis you can find here https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/
We have a sample of 1394 movies and we want to fit a model to predict whether a film passes the test or not.
